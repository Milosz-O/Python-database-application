# Python_database_application
Python application working with local database 

The whole application was animals atlas where you could add, remove, change and show animals. I tried to make the GUI as simple as possible, but at the same time easy to
use. I didn't put any thought into how the GUI looked, I wanted it to be functional. The app had a login system which also works with the database, where all 
the accounts are being held. The whole project uses sqlalchemy, pandas, numpy for database connection and tkinter for the GUI.
